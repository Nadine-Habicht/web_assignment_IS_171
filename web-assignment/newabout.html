			<h3> Historical background </h3>
				<p class="text"> Canossa High School was established on 9th January, 2006 as an all-girls school and it is owned by the "Canossian Sisters." It was initially a day school thus most of the girls who joined were from Tegeta and its neighborhood. Girls from far started to join as the school grew thus two hostels were found near the school to accomodate them. </p>
